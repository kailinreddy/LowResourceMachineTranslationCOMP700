How To Run Code:

In the code notebook, there is a Python notebook and the .py file. You may choose to view whichever you prefer. 

1. This notebook is best optimized to be run on Google Colab. If you wish to run it on a python editor (Pycharm) or Kaggle, then where I have my file path in block 3, change that to your file path where your dataset is loaded.

2. Using your GPU as your runtime is recommended to avoid waiting a long time for the model to train.

3. When connecting to your Google Drive, a prompt will open your browser to sign in to Google. If you are not connecting your Google drive, refer to step 1.

4. After connecting your database, you are free to run each segment and change things around as you feel.
